## SQL Employee Tracker
# Challenge #12 - Week 12:

# Project Description
### What is this project?
Here is an application that enables its user to view, and manage their companies departments, employee roles, and employees. This application strongly utilises the SQL package. 

### Files modified
For this project I have been tasked to create files from scratch and ensure the application follows the criteria. This includes several sql files, db.js and server.js.

### Challenges
There have been several challenges that I encountered throughout the making of this application. However, a major takeaway is me getting used to the SQL syntax and implementing it properly for the tables to be displayed properly. After much trial and error, it was resolved. 

# Installation
To use this application, the user will be required to make a few installations. Firstly you'll need to use the MySQL2 package to connect to the MySQL database and perform queries. The Inquirer package for the user to interact with prompts via the commend line is a must, and the console.table package is essential to print MySQL tables in the console. One final package that the user will install is the DotEnv package.

# Usage
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
